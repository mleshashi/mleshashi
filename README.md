## Projects

### [Master's Thesis: Chart Retrieval for Arguments](https://github.com/mleshashi/thesis-sharma)
Developed a multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using large language models and Elasticsearch to enable efficient chart retrieval and response generation based on both text and visual inputs.

### [Multimodal Sequence Representations for FEED Data](https://github.com/webis-de/argmining23-image-arg)
Contributed to the ImageArg Shared Task by implementing neural models to classify tweets by stance and image persuasiveness on controversial topics.
**Publication:** Our team published a paper based on this work! You can read it [here](https://aclanthology.org/2023.argmining-1.16/).

### [Amazon-Fine-Food-Reviews](https://github.com/mleshashi/Amazon-Fine-Food-Reviews)
Data analysis on Amazon Fine Food Reviews using machine learning models to derive insights from consumer feedback. Focuses on sentiment analysis and predictive modeling to understand customer preferences.

### [Eco-Riders](https://github.com/mleshashi/Eco-Riders)
A carpooling web app created for the HACK NOW! Hackathon 2024 by NTT DATA, promoting sustainable stadium travel. Connects fans for carpooling, tracks COâ‚‚ savings, and rewards eco-friendly choices.

### [autogenProject](https://github.com/mleshashi/autogenProject)
An automated email agent that fetches, analyzes, and intelligently replies to emails using Gmailâ€™s IMAP/SMTP servers. Uses AI-driven response generation for context-aware, personalized replies.

### [Machine-Learning](https://github.com/mleshashi/Machine-Learning)
A collection of machine learning assignments and projects, covering algorithms and techniques like decision trees, neural networks, and logistic regression. Includes foundational exercises and practical applications from Coursera studies.
